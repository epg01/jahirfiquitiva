# 👋 Hello, world!

I'm Jahir Fiquitiva and I'm a passionate and creative full-stack developer from [Colombia 🇨🇴](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colombia/@4,-72z/)

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia.

I consider myself a curious and inquisitive person and a continuous learner, so on my spare time I like to work on side projects and try to keep learning new stuff to improve my skillset.

If you are interested in knowing which tools I use, you can [check out my uses page](https://jahir.dev/uses).
